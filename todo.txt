-- alloc.c: can now be removed, it's only
ever used for doing temporary thread allocations,
and that can be its own thing without need the
allocator construct at all

-- elf-aux.c: can be completely removed...
it's just a bunch of code for printing stuff, getting program
info, I think it can be put on core.c, the other line information
stuff can be... idk

-- error.h: remove

-- core.c: make iton and ntoi intrinsic!

-- table.c: sorting!



































/* Todo: better logging, with colors, with so many warnings
and things, its hard to tell the difference between a log
and an error */

/* Todo: NEW is used quite often, probably turn into an
instruction eventually, also, for now when we do get
metatable, and invoke __new, we don't check whether it
is null or not, so this requires the user to provide a
__new function, which is fine, but, we don't get an error
saying so... */

- parse.c: issue a parse time warning or error when the
user makes reference to some undeclared entity, it's kinda
annoying to have to wait for the program to run then get a
nil error or some subtle weird thing...

- parse.c: constant declarations '::=' within table
initializers should just be treated as locally
scoped constants...
Actually, why don't we allow abitrary statements
and cull every declaration and or definition outside
of the statements, and the user can set a key value
pair using 'this.something'?

- parse.c, core.c: named arguments?

- parse.c: when parsing 'new' we use parse postfix
expression, which does not do proper grouping of terms,
like for instance:

;		new Rect(...):overalps()
So figure out what to do here...

- parse.c: multi nodes with binary expressions,
offset.(x,y) * 0.5 -> (offset.x * 0.5, offset.y * 0.5)
multi node desugaring should be held off until an expression
that is actually compatible with them can use them...

- core.c: abs, max, min, floor, ceil, round intrinsic instructions!

- core.c: vector intrinsic instruction

- core.c: a proper argument validator, that
can be externalized, this would also help
in augmenting documentation and self-optimization.


- collision.elf: #bug fix #worstbugever

- parse.c, core.c: #feature constants should
not become closure captures...

- parse.c: #feature function arrow syntax

- parse.c: #feature why do relational operators
have higher precedence than bitwise operators?
I've never liked this!

- core.c: #feature
let user define result value when
division by zero?

- parse.c: #feature
tuple iteration in a for loop:
for x,y = (0,1), (2,2) ? {
}
for x,y = (0,1)...(2,2) ? {
}

- parse.c: #feature
'for' loop range does not allow configuring
the step and direction, use 'by' keyword as
suggested?
for i = 0...10 by 1 ? {

}

- parse.c: #bug
'?=' operator not setting parameter properly
when parameter is nil?
my_fun = fun(color) ? {
color ?= {r=255,g=255,b=255,a=255}
}
'color' is '{}'

-	core.c: "attempted to get nil field" error
message when doing array indexing with nil key,
this is not a good error code!

-	GAME API: #core
Begin working on a standard game
dev API to support different backends without
having to port each and every single one.
We have lower level apis the GPU stuff, but still
shared across different GPU API's.
Device standard image formats, add support for
image loading using stb_image.h, images should
be compatible with all backends.



-	elf-ray.c: begin working on getting raylib port
ready again
- 	test web compilation?
-  parse.c: we can't have cross file constants,
why not make all title case names constant?
That way global symbols can be defined as
enum like.
- 	parse.c: range expression desugaring
-	parse.c: conditionals, introduce conditional
expression, they wrap some other expression,
if the expression is nil, the rest isn't executed
and the result is nil, so the user can pair it
up with the nil or operator.
- 	lib_user.c: gesture messages
-	lexer.c: add support for floating point notation!
- 	GOAL TODAY (1/7/25):
- 	x-- get games working!
-	xx closures, we need capts
-	parse.c: for loops need to use := ::=
syntax to be more consistent...
- 	x- parse.c: defer blocks, do while loops
we need to fix defer blocks so that they
are actually emitted properly...
maybe use the goto instruction along
with labels to chain these together...
like every inner block will emit these
goto instructions and store them in
their blocks, and then the parent block
takes those instructions and patches adds
them to itself, until a terminating
statement is found
{
defer { elf.pf("do this last") }
...
{
{
...
ret 2
}
...
ret 1
}
...
ret 2
}
todo: this is temporary!
Whenever a block is ended, right before
the ending instruction we insert the
defer blocks, if we are an inner block
and we do a return, instead of actually
issuing the return instruction we just
jump to the return instruction at the
end of every function.
-	core.c: comparison optimizations
-	core.c: instructions for nil conditional
jumps...
- 	core.c: active prefixes, so the user can
enable a prefix, and every global symbol
from then on will have that prefix, the
prefix must adhere to certain rules!
-	parse.c: NO_ENTITY should be 0, not -1
-	parse.c: introduce the preloading idea
once again to optimize certain expressions:
(A.B.C).D ?= 1
^^^^^^ <- otherwise this gets expensive since
it has to be evaluated twice...
-	core.c: add better error logging, especially
for when the parser generates code to call
the __new function and it isn't present because
the user didn't define it, the core will just
say, "cannot call nil", like what does that
even mean!
Perhaps, add an instruction for calling new...
-	parse.c: ternary expressions
parse?:name()
parse:name?()
parse?.name
- 	remove the idea of a meta-call
from gen, let the parse include
'this'.
And this will also give also remove
the notion of 'this' entirely from
the generator.
-  sublime syntax highlight
-	core.c: revise the core API!
-	xx break / continue, they should take the for loop
as the operand
-	x- parse.c: infinite ranges, nameless loops
-	xxx- parser.c: clean up parser
-  change declaration syntax, from 'let' to ':='
-  set_line function to avoid having to pass in the
line every single time
-	core.c: calling a function should not be recursive
-	parse.c: type annotations
-  gen.c: specialized bytecode for known types
-	parse.c: default parameter values
-  core.c & parse.c & gen.c: array index instrinsics!
-	parse.c: make it so that global references aren't implicit,
this tends to not be a big problem but it does get
annoying
-	lib_sockets.c: sockets...
-	lib_threads.c: threading...
-	parse.c: meta postprocessor?
-	core.c: generate profiling data so that we can
visualize it, John Blow style.
- 	help.h: rename to base.h, put core type defs
in there
- 	core.c: calling functions should not be recursive
-	core.c: figure out what to do with the vector
values idea, do we want every value to
be a vector? (postpone)
-	parse.c: block strings, inplace formatted strings
shader =
"""
void main() {
gl_FragColor = vec3(1,2,3)
}
"""
- 	add an end of line token instead of
using passive hinting? (postpone)
- 	revise the table core lib, should
we just add the array type?
-  can we get color logging?
-  x- delete un-used files, elf-web.c,lcrtlib.c,elf-cli.c?
-  cleanup core file
-	clean up globals
-	proper test suite
- 	#array, #index, #value registers
this could actually be done with
entity binding, simply bind the entity
to each corresponding tree,
-	xx !! and ??
-	allow the user to refer to for loops by name
-  xx proper assignments!
-  parse.c: #syntax What happens when you have multiple expressions
on a single line?
They just get evaluated, or discarded,
but that should be a syntax error
-  byte.c: fix stupid bytecode!
-  byte.h & core.c: get rid of yield, delay, and leave instructions they
are no longer in use!
- 	parse.c & gen.c: 'then' branch will require us to
move the entire if elif thing to the generator.
-  parse.c & gen.c: multi-returns
-  parse.c & gen.c: change the calling convetion so that
the 'this' param comes first, then the function then
arguments, and fully expose these registers.
Putting 'this' as the first argument means it'll be
the default return value without having to emit additional
code. (postpone)
- 	xx elifs
-	xx fields, indices, metafield (postfix expressions)
-  xx array for-loops, generic for loops
-	xx function parameters, 'this'
-	re-introduce groups, we need them for proper code gen now
-  fix short circuiting bug
-	merge module and state?
-	clean up, delete old files
- 	get rid of elf-web.c
- 	get rid of jit toy we have 'c66' as a
much better reference
- 	get rid of error.h, or make it better
-  figure out whether we want function types or not,
then:
- 	determine what a file really is and whether we
need them...
- 	Will prototypes always remain loaded, can get
rid of the unused ones?
-	If files are a thing, will a file keep all prototypes
loaded, even when not in use?
- 	If there are no files, do we keep the source code for
each file?
-	If prototypes are dynamic, will they become objects too?
Or will they get treated separately?
-	Will bytecode be allocated per prototype or still be
emitted to the same buffer?
- 	organize library, organize elf.h
-	figure what the API for the core
library will be, setup some constraints
it should adhere to.
-	core lib function that tells you whether
an object is visible, and tells the path.
- bytecode should be much smaller
- use linear allocator for internal stuff, like
allocating instructions and stuff...
